## Exploring Data Storage Options for User Scores (18/04/2025, 19:42:08)

_**User**_

Let's keep this conversation scoped to exploring different options to store and retrieve data, and not about implementing the changes. When we finalise a approach, let's document the plan in detail at the end. Let's have this as conversation.

I am a beginner in the backend and data modelling part, I have come up with the schema defined here based on some recommendations for the user score application.

Go through the schema @schema.prisma  file. We need explore options about storing the data differently/enhancing what is possible so that the data can be accessed easily and in a performant manner. 

For example, in the Dashboard, we want to show the ranking of all the users. In order to do that, we are pulling in `user` table, `userScore` table. Inside `userScore` table, we are pullin the `match`, and `user` table data as well. We are doing this because we are storing the data for each match and the statistics are calculated in the runtime. (For example in the `loader` part of `dashboard`).

If we are not calculating the these stats during the runtime, and have a dedicated table say `stats` that has all the stats we want to show in the dashboard page, how to keep that updated based on the match results.? 

To give some context on database, We are using postgresql DB from Supabase.
@dashboard.tsx

Okay, I understand. You've built a solid foundation with your current Prisma schema and the dashboard implementation. It's smart to think ahead about performance and maintainability as your application grows.

You're right, calculating the user rankings, total scores, matches won/lost, etc., directly in the `dashboard.tsx` loader by querying and processing potentially large amounts of `UserScore` data can become inefficient over time. Every time someone loads the dashboard, the server needs to re-fetch and re-calculate everything.

Your idea of introducing a dedicated table, let's call it `UserStats`, to store these pre-calculated values is a common and effective pattern for optimizing read-heavy scenarios like a dashboard.

The schema for such a table might look something like this (just conceptually):

```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields ...
  stats UserStats? // One-to-one relationship
}

model UserStats {
  userId       String   @id // Links back to the User
  user         User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])

  totalScore   Float    @default(0)
  matchesPlayed Int      @default(0)
  matchesWon   Int      @default(0)
  matchesLost  Int      @default(0)
  // You could add ranking here too, or calculate it based on sorted scores
  // ranking      Int?

  updatedAt    DateTime @updatedAt

  // Maybe indexes for sorting
  @@index([totalScore])
  // @@index([ranking])
}
```

With this table, your dashboard loader would become much simpler and faster: it would just need to query the `UserStats` table, perhaps join with `User` to get names, and sort by `totalScore` (or a pre-calculated `ranking`).

The core challenge, as you pointed out, is: **How do we keep this `UserStats` table accurate and up-to-date whenever `UserScore` data changes?**

There are a few main approaches we can explore:

1.  **Update Stats in Application Logic:**
    *   **How it works:** Modify your existing `action` function (or wherever scores are created/updated). After successfully saving a `UserScore`, trigger a process to recalculate and update the relevant statistics in the `UserStats` table for the user(s) involved in that match.
    *   **Pros:** Keeps all logic within your application code (TypeScript/Remix). Might feel more familiar if you're less comfortable with database-level programming.
    *   **Cons:** Can make your score submission `action` more complex and potentially slower, as it now has to do extra reads and calculations. Need careful handling to ensure accuracy, especially around calculating wins/losses which depend on *all* scores within a match, not just the one being updated. Handling deletions of scores also needs consideration.

2.  **Use Database Triggers (PostgreSQL):**
    *   **How it works:** You can define functions directly within your PostgreSQL database (using PL/pgSQL) that automatically run whenever a row in the `UserScore` table is inserted, updated, or deleted. These functions would contain the logic to recalculate and update the corresponding `UserStats` row(s).
    *   **Pros:** Logic lives close to the data, ensuring updates happen atomically with score changes. Can be very performant. Guarantees data consistency at the database level.
    *   **Cons:** Requires writing and maintaining SQL code (triggers and functions), which might be a different skillset. Logic is hidden in the database, potentially making it harder to debug from the application perspective. Less portable if you ever switch database vendors away from PostgreSQL.

3.  **Periodic Batch Recalculation:**
    *   **How it works:** Create a separate background process (e.g., a scheduled job/task â€“ Supabase might offer scheduled functions for this) that runs periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes, every hour). This job would recalculate *all* user stats from scratch based on the `UserScore` table and update the `UserStats` table entirely.
    *   **Pros:** Simplifies the score submission logic (no immediate recalculation needed). Offloads the heavy calculation work from the user request path. Relatively simple to implement the calculation logic (similar to your current loader).
    *   **Cons:** The stats shown on the dashboard will have some delay (staleness) depending on how often the job runs. Requires setting up and potentially paying for background job infrastructure. The recalculation itself can be resource-intensive.

Each approach has trade-offs between implementation complexity, performance, real-time accuracy, and where the logic resides (application vs. database).

What are your initial thoughts on these options? Does one approach feel more aligned with your comfort level or project requirements than others? For instance, how critical is it for the dashboard stats to be updated *instantly* versus being slightly delayed?

I want to explore more on option 2 about using database triggers. How much of the effort you think it will be. Except for the debugging part and less portable part, I guess this makes more sense. How do I create such triggers, try to give me a basic example to try out in a supabase db. I will create one for prototyping the concept first as I don't want to take risk on the existing DB. Let me know the things I need to be careful for as I am a beginner in the DB side.

Okay, exploring database triggers is a great choice for ensuring data consistency and offloading the calculation logic from your application.

**Effort Estimation:**

For a beginner, there will be a learning curve, mostly around understanding PostgreSQL's procedural language (PL/pgSQL) and the concept of triggers.

*   **Initial Setup:** Getting the basic structure of the trigger function and trigger definition might take a few hours of focused learning and experimentation.
*   **Logic Implementation:** Translating your current dashboard calculation logic (total score, matches played, wins, losses) into SQL will be the main part of the effort. This could range from a few hours to a couple of days, depending on how complex the logic gets (especially wins/losses, which require comparing a user's score to the max/min score within the *same* match).
*   **Testing & Debugging:** Thorough testing is crucial. Debugging triggers can be trickier than application code, so allocate time for this.

Overall, it's a moderate effort, but achievable, and the skills learned are valuable for backend development. The key is to start simple and build up.

**How Triggers Work in PostgreSQL:**

1.  **Trigger Function:** This is a user-defined function written in a procedural language (usually PL/pgSQL). It contains the logic that should execute when the trigger fires. It often receives information about the event (like the new or old row data).
2.  **Trigger:** This defines *when* the trigger function should run. You specify:
    *   The **event**: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `TRUNCATE`.
    *   The **timing**: `BEFORE` or `AFTER` the event occurs on a row.
    *   The **table**: The table the trigger is attached to (e.g., `UserScore`).
    *   The **granularity**: `FOR EACH ROW` (runs for every affected row) or `FOR EACH STATEMENT` (runs once per SQL statement).
    *   The **function**: The trigger function to execute.

**Basic Example (Conceptual - Focusing on `totalScore` and `matchesPlayed`):**

Let's assume you have the `UserStats` table as described before.

1.  **Create the `UserStats` table (if it doesn't exist):**
    *   You'd run SQL like `CREATE TABLE "UserStats" ...` (using the structure we discussed).
    *   You also need to ensure every `User` has a corresponding `UserStats` row. You could create a trigger on the `User` table for inserts, or handle this during user creation in your app. For simplicity, let's assume `UserStats` rows exist for relevant users.

2.  **Create the Trigger Function:**
    This function will update the `UserStats
