## Fixing TypeScript Error in Generic Table Logic (12/04/2025, 12:14:00)

_**User**_

I have updated the logic to reduce opacity of rows for which there is no winner in line number 57. 

I want to fix the typescript error on line 57. If I remove the `ts-ignore` comment, it's showing that winner does not exist on row.original. I think it's because this is a generic table and not tied to the match. (@columns.tsx ) in @matchescard.tsx .

Is there a way to fix the typescript issue? and is there any other place this logic can be incorporated if this is not the recommended place?

I'll help you fix the TypeScript error related to the winner property. First, let me examine the relevant files to understand the DataTable component and where the opacity logic is implemented.

Let me look at the matches data-table.tsx file to find line 57 with the opacity logic:

Now I can see the issue. On line 57 (according to your message), you have this line:

```typescript
// @ts-ignore
const isNoWinnder = row.original.winner === "No winner";
```

The TypeScript error occurs because `row.original` is of the generic type `TData`, which doesn't explicitly define a `winner` property. Let's fix this issue properly.

Here are a few solutions:

### Option 1: Type assertion in data-table.tsx

```typescript
// Instead of @ts-ignore
const isNoWinner = (row.original as any).winner === "No winner";
```

### Option 2 (Better): Type Guard

```typescript
const isNoWinner = 'winner' in row.original ? row.original.winner === "No Winner" : false;
```

### Option 3 (Best): Generic Constraint

Instead of modifying the data-table.tsx, you can modify the DataTableProps interface to ensure that TData has a winner property. Let's implement this approach:

```typescript
interface DataTableProps<TData extends { winner?: string }, TValue> {
  columns: ColumnDef<TData, TValue>[];
  data: TData[];
}

export function DataTable<TData extends { winner?: string }, TValue>({
  columns,
  data,
}: DataTableProps<TData, TValue>) {
  // ...
  
  // Now you can safely access winner
  const isNoWinner = row.original.winner === "No winner";
}
```

### Alternative Approach

If you prefer to keep the generic table component truly generic, another approach would be to move this logic to the columns.tsx file, where the Match type is already defined:

```typescript
// In columns.tsx
export const columns: ColumnDef<Match>[] = [
  // other columns...
  {
    id: "rowClassName",
    cell: ({ row }) => null,
    meta: {
      getRowClassName: (row: Match) => {
        return row.winner === "No winner" ? "opacity-20" : "";
      }
    }
  }
];

// Then in data-table.tsx
<TableRow
  key={row.id}
  data-state={row.getIsSelected() && "selected"}
  className={(row.original as any).winner === "No winner" ? "opacity-20" : ""}
  // Or using the meta approach:
  // className={table.options.meta?.getRowClassName?.(row.original) || ""}
>
```

Given your specific use case and code structure, I recommend implementing Option 3 (Generic Constraint) in your data-table.tsx file. This ensures type safety while still allowing the component to be reused for different data types that have a winner property.
