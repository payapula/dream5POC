## Loading Environment Variables in Prisma (03/04/2025, 09:20:33)

_**User**_

When I run `npx prisma migrate dev` it always loads env file from `.env` at root. How do I specify it to load the envs from `.env.local` ?  Is there an option?

_**Assistant**_

Prisma by default looks for a `.env` file at the root of your project. If you want to use a different environment file like `.env.local`, you have a few options:

### Option 1: Use the `--schema` flag

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --schema=./path/to/schema.prisma
```

In your schema.prisma file, you can specify the environment file:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  // Other configurations...
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
  // If using Node 18.16.0+
  engineType = "binary"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  // Specify the env file
  directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")
}
```

### Option 2: Use the `dotenv-cli` package

Install dotenv-cli:

```bash
npm install -g dotenv-cli
```

Then run Prisma commands with it:

```bash
dotenv -e .env.local -- npx prisma migrate dev
```

This will load the environment variables from `.env.local` before running the Prisma command.

### Option 3: Rename or copy your file

You could also simply copy or rename your `.env.local` file to `.env` before running the Prisma commands:

```bash
cp .env.local .env
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### Option 4: Set environment variables manually

You can set the environment variables directly in your terminal session:

```bash
export $(cat .env.local | grep -v '^#' | xargs) && npx prisma migrate dev
```

The second option using `dotenv-cli` is typically the cleanest approach if you regularly need to use different environment files with Prisma commands.

I have pasted the output of users that comes from loader in @dashboard.tsx .

I notice a discrepancy in the data, which probably could be a bug. 

The total matchesWon including all users is 8, but toal matchesLost is 9.

The total matches played is 8. So somewhere our calculation is wrong in the loader. Can you please double check and let me know what are we missing?

_**Assistant**_

Looking at your `dashboard.tsx` loader code and the output, I can see the bug in your match win/loss calculation. Let's analyze what's happening:

The issue is in how you're calculating `matchesWon` and `matchesLost` in your loader function:

```typescript:app/routes/dashboard.tsx
userScores.forEach((score) => {
  const stats = matchStats[score.matchId];
  // Use approximate equality for floating point comparison
  if (Math.abs(score.score - stats.highestScore) < 0.001) matchesWon++;
  if (Math.abs(score.score - stats.lowestScore) < 0.001) matchesLost++;
});
```

### The Bug

For each match, you're:
1. Finding users with the highest score and marking them as winners
2. Finding users with the lowest score and marking them as losers

The problem is that **multiple users can have the same highest or lowest score in a match**. This means:
- If two users tie for highest score, both get counted as winners
- If two users tie for lowest score, both get counted as losers

This explains why your total wins (8) and total losses (9) don't match the total matches (8).

### Solution

Here's how to fix it:

```typescript:app/routes/dashboard.tsx
// ... existing code ...

// Calculate stats for each user
const userStats = users.map((user) => {
  const userScores = allScores.filter((score) => score.userId === user.id);

  // Use proper decimal addition
  const totalScore = Number(
    userScores.reduce((sum, score) => sum + score.score, 0).toFixed(1)
  );

  let matchesWon = 0;
  let matchesLost = 0;

  // Group all scores by match ID
  const matchGroups = Object.values(scoresByMatch);
  
  // Check each match the user participated in
  userScores.forEach((userScore) => {
    // Get all scores for this match
    const matchScores = scoresByMatch[userScore.matchId];
    
    // Find the highest and lowest scores for this match
    const highestScore = Math.max(...matchScores.map(s => s.score));
    const lowestScore = Math.min(...matchScores.map(s => s.score));
    
    // Check if this user's score is the highest (win)
    if (Math.abs(userScore.score - highestScore) < 0.001 && 
        // Count as win only if they're the only one with highest score
        matchScores.filter(s => Math.abs(s.score - highestScore) < 0.001).length === 1) {
      matchesWon++;
    }
    
    // Check if this user's score is the lowest (loss)
    if (Math.abs(userScore.score - lowestScore) < 0.001 && 
        // Count as loss only if they're the only one with lowest score
        matchScores.filter(s => Math.abs(s.score - lowestScore) < 0.001).length === 1) {
      matchesLost++;
    }
  });

  return {
    id: user.id,
    name: user.name,
    displayName: user.displayName,
    totalScore,
    matchesWon,
    matchesLost,
  };
});

// ... existing code ...
```

Alternatively, if you want to count ties differently, you could:

1. Add a third category for "ties" 
2. Only count as win if score is strictly greater than all others
3. Only count as loss if score is strictly less than all others

Let me know which approach better matches your game's rules!
