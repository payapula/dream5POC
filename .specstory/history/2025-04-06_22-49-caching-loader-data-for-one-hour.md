## Caching Loader Data for One Hour (06/04/2025, 22:49:29)

_**User**_

How do we add caching to loader data. I want the response to be cached for 1 hour. 

---

_**Assistant**_

You've already implemented caching correctly in your code. The `data` function from react-router in your `loader` function includes a headers object with a Cache-Control directive:

```tsx
return data(
  { matches: matchesWithStats },
  {
    headers: {
      "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=3600",
    },
  }
);
```

This sets a cache duration of 3600 seconds (1 hour), making the response public (cacheable by browsers and CDNs). The `max-age=3600` directive specifies that the cached content is valid for one hour before needing revalidation.

How do I test if this is working?

_**Assistant**_

To test if your caching is working, you can:

1. Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect)
2. Go to the Network tab
3. Navigate to the matches page
4. Find the network request for the matches data
5. Check the response headers - you should see "Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600"
6. Refresh the page and observe if the request shows "(from disk cache)" or "(from memory cache)"

You can also verify by looking at the "Time" column in the Network tab - cached responses should load significantly faster on subsequent requests.

In the matches page for the network response "matches.data" I don't see the "cache-control" in response headers and I dont' think the response is cached. Can you please check?

Let me check what might be happening with your cache configuration.
