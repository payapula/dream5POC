Update this header to be a nav bar with some basic css styles.

I'll help you update the Header component to be a more styled navigation bar, keeping in mind this is a mobile-only application and using Tailwind CSS. I'll add some common mobile navigation styling patterns.

Here's the updated code:

```typescript:app/root.tsx
function Header() {
  return (
    <header className="fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 bg-white border-b border-gray-200 z-50">
      <nav className="container mx-auto px-4 h-14 flex items-center justify-between">
        <Link to="/" className="text-xl font-semibold">
          Dream5
        </Link>
        <Link 
          to="/matches" 
          className="px-4 py-2 rounded-full bg-blue-500 text-white text-sm font-medium hover:bg-blue-600 active:bg-blue-700 transition-colors"
        >
          Matches
        </Link>
      </nav>
    </header>
  );
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Made the header fixed at the top of the screen with `fixed top-0 left-0 right-0`
2. Added a white background and subtle border at the bottom
3. Added z-index to ensure the header stays above other content
4. Set a specific height for the navbar (h-14 = 56px)
5. Added padding on the sides (px-4)
6. Styled the "Dream5" logo with larger text and semi-bold weight
7. Replaced the underlined "Matches" link with a more prominent button-style link using rounded-full and blue color scheme
8. Added hover and active states for better interaction feedback

Note: Since this is a fixed header, you might want to add some padding to your main content to prevent it from being hidden behind the header. You can do this by adding `pt-14` to your main content wrapper.
