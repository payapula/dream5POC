## Updating userScore table with Prisma (03/04/2025, 20:16:22)

_**User**_

@schema.prisma I am trying to update userScore table with the data I received in the format

```
  matchId: '5',
  User1: '12',
  User2: '12',
  User3: '19.5',
  User4: '334',
  User5: '34.5'
```

Using `prisma.userScore.upsert` command to update as per logic. But I am getting the error "

```

Invalid `prisma.userScore.upsert()` invocation:
Foreign key constraint violated: `UserScore_userId_fkey (index)`
PrismaClientKnownRequestError: 
Invalid `prisma.userScore.upsert()` invocation:
```

Can you help me update userScore table? Let me know if there is any other way to update the table. Feel free to suggest me ideas.

To update the userScore table with the provided data, we need to make a few changes:

1. The data is provided in a format where the user IDs are not directly available. We need to extract the user IDs from the keys like "User1", "User2", etc.

2. We need to loop through the data and make an upsert call for each user-score pair.

3. To avoid the foreign key constraint violation, we need to ensure that the user IDs we're using actually exist in the User table.

The relevant tools for this task are:
- read_file: To view the existing code in dashboard.tsx and schema.prisma to understand the data model and current implementation.
- edit_file: To make the necessary changes in dashboard.tsx to correctly update the userScore table.

We have all the required information to proceed with the tool calls.

The read_file calls provided a good understanding of the existing code structure and data model. We were able to see how the userScore table is currently being updated in the action function, and also understand the relationship between the User and UserScore tables in the schema.

However, to actually make the necessary changes to correctly update the userScore table, we need the ability to edit the code. The edit_file tool is not available in this environment.

So while we have a good understanding of what changes need to be made, we don't have the capability to actually implement those changes. We'll need to provide the user with the suggested code changes and have them make the edits.

Based on the provided data format and the existing code, here are the changes you'll need to make in your `dashboard.tsx` file to correctly update the `userScore` table:

```typescript:app/routes/dashboard.tsx
// ... existing code ...
export async function action({ request }: Route.ActionArgs) {
  let formData = await request.formData();
  const data = Object.fromEntries(formData.entries());

  const userIds = await prisma.user.findMany({
    select: { id: true, name: true },
  });
  const userMap = new Map(userIds.map(({ id, name }) => [name, id]));

  const upserts = Object.entries(data)
    .filter(([key]) => key.startsWith("User"))
    .map(([key, score]) => {
      const userId = userMap.get(key);
      if (!userId) {
        throw new Error(`User ${key} not found`);
      }
      return prisma.userScore.upsert({
        where: {
          userId_matchId: {
            userId,
            matchId: data.matchId as string,
          },
        },
        update: {
          score: Number(score),
        },
        create: {
          userId,
          matchId: data.matchId as string,
          score: Number(score),
        },
      });
    });

  await Promise.all(upserts);

  return null;
}
// ... existing code ...
```

Here's what this code does:

1. It converts the `formData` into a plain object using `Object.fromEntries()` for easier access.

2. It fetches all user IDs and names from the database and creates a Map to look up user IDs by their name (e.g. "User1", "User2", etc).

3. It filters the data object to only the entries starting with "User", and maps each one to a `prisma.userScore.upsert()` call.

4. For each upsert call, it looks up the actual user ID using the Map created earlier. If no user is found for a given key, it throws an error.

5. It uses the `userId_matchId` compound unique key to upsert the score, updating it if it already exists or creating a new one if it doesn't.

6. It wraps all the upsert calls in a `Promise.all()` so they execute in parallel for better performance.

This should resolve the foreign key constraint violation you were seeing, because it ensures that only valid user IDs that exist in the `User` table are used when upserting into `UserScore`.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
